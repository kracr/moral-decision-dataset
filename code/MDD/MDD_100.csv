Alice owns a small business - for the sake of the scenario, let's say a computer repair shop. She owns the building where the shop is located and employs three technicians - Boris, Carl, and Doris. Alice dies peacefully in her sleep of natural causes. In her will, she leaves everything pertaining to her business to Doris, who is also the assistant manager and is familiar with all the finances, payroll, etc. 

Would Doris be able to continue operating the business (after perhaps a brief closure) while any longer-term legal/inheritance questions are being settled? Or what would happen? What sort of concerns would Doris have to deal with in this scenario?"
Teacher seeks help creating game show for high school students to learn law concepts.,Create game show,Educational Ethics,Teacher,High school students,Engagement and learning,0.8,0.9,0.7,0.9,"Respect, Integrity, Reciprocity",,morally right,"The teacher's intention is to engage and educate students, and the game show is a creative way to do so.","This semester I am in a Street Law class that has placed me and a partnered classmate in a local high school classroom to teach kids about law stuff. So far it has not been going well. A few kids are pretty engaged, but most are just tired and bored. I want to pivot away from a traditional lesson and do something more fun and exciting to get their interest sparked, and hopefully slip in some lesson too. To that end, I've decided to create a game of ""Um, Actually"" for them. For those unfamiliar, ""Um, Actually"" is a game show on Dropout.tv. The premise of the game is that in each round, the host will read off a statement that has an inaccuracy somewhere in it, and the first contestant to chime in and offer the right correction gets the point. For example:

&gt;

The correct answer to this question would be ""Um, actually, the Fellowship sets out from *Rivendell*. Riverdale is where Archie, Jughead, and the gang live."" [Here's a random episode available on YouTube for more context](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKP9XcCEhho).

So thats where I'm turning to you, the good people of reddit, for help. I am asking for suggestions of ""incorrect statements"" that I can present to the high school students for them to try and find the incorrect detail. I don't want things impossibly hard for them, but at the same time, I want the statements to be hard enough that they are left up for students to read and re-read looking for the wrong detail. Something like what I'm going for would be

&gt;

(The answer being ""Um, actually, appeals courts don't look at new evidence, just what transpired in the court room).

Even if you don't have specific statements to suggest, suggestions for topics that I should try and craft a statement around would be just as appreciated. Thanks for any help you are able to provide in advance!"

In the US, for example, federal law prohibits Misprision of a Felony [18 USC 4], but the language of the statute makes clear that there must be *concealment* beyond mere failure to report; according to Wikipedia, similar laws criminalizing mere failure to report existed in many nations but have long been repealed.

A practical explanation would be that the “worst” crimes tend to be on the investigatory radar anyway, making it unnecessary and burdensome to require people to report other crimes.  Or perhaps, along the same lines, the social cost of burdening friends, family, etc. with pain of prosecution for failing to report more “technical” crimes outweighs the resulting reduction in unsolved crime.

Still, even if usually unenforced, such a statute could be a tool for more easily prosecuting accessories to serious crimes (like child abuse) that they certainly have a moral duty to prevent as able.

In that case, the judge ruled that she had been maliciously concealing assets and gave all the winnings to the husband. But what if the order of events had been different? What if she’d bought a lotto ticket, filed for divorce, and then won the lottery? The time between lotto drawings is usually pretty brief, so a more practical example might be a parlay between on the outcome of multiple sporting events — there would be many months between when the bet is open and when it closed, and there was a news story of a man recently who made a $100 bet that was ultimately worth $1.1 million, though he sold it on to another bettor before it paid off.

How might it be handled in a situation where someone purchases something like a lotto ticket or a wager, and then gets divorced or has assets seized as part of bankruptcy?

So I'm a drama and creative writing student in my 3rd year. For one module I've decided to write something similar to modern love but with more work shown so you get a sense of the character as a professional and her relationship with colleagues more. I'm nervous on researching the law aspects. I've done jury service so I know what kind of things go down in reality which is probably why I've chosen to do it other than the fact I liked modern love episode 3 (so typical of me). 

Anyways I was wondering where would be a good source for research around entertainment law trials? Specifically around defamation... also any videos of court hearings on YouTube other than amber and Johnny... 

Part of me thinks family law would be ""easier"" to nail because there seems to be more easily accessible research sources? I've seen it on tv a few times (I know it's all drama and not real but it helps me understand the drama of it kind of.)  If anyone knows any famous cases I could read up on would be helpful too.

Also if anyone is willing to give feedback on whether I've nailed it when it comes to writing that would be really helpful for me! Also if anyone wants to share opinions about which they would rather read in the novel assuming those in the field would be interested in the novel I would appreciate them in the comments. I'm feeling indecisive whether to change to from the original idea (first paragraph) to another (second paragraph).

Its my third year so I think with that in mind I'm nervous around it... I don't want to chose one then regret it later because I didn't get a good grade for it. I'm confident I could do hearing scenes it's just making it believable I guess... I don't know. My lecturer has a court case in her novel which makes my stakes high also. For extra context I'm thinking to set my novel in the US if it's entertainment law and maybe uk based for custody battle. But either works for custody I guess. "

When I shared about this to my friends, we were divided into two groups. 

One being, it’s a free country, Reddit is a free platform. You can name the business or individual since what you’re providing is your own view. 

The other being, this can be considered as cyber bullying towards the owner. 

So, how does it actually work? I know internet is a dark place and anything I post will stay. But if one stays in the US, and what one may ever post would be their own opinion and their perception of the truth; wouldn’t it be protected under first amendment.

I am originally from Connecticut — almost my entire family (and most of my friends) live in New England/the Northeast.

I, however, identify with the values, lifestyles and politics of states far from home. For example, one of my 'dream states’ — a place I would like to live — is Wyoming. Another would be Tennessee...

I am confident I can get into a law school in one of these places, and I am confident I can earn the degree and pass the bar, but I don’t know what it’s like getting employed/earning an income as a lawyer post-Law School, especially if I am in a place where I have no real connection outside of my short tenure as \*law student\*.

My question is: how good of an idea is it to attend law school in a far, distant place where you have no social network? Will the lack of connection to the place (outside of the 3 years you spend living there) make finding employment or earning an income difficult?

\[In some sense, my question is really just about the Legal Profession’s early career placement mechanism. Is it super meritocratic and, like, 'open-source’? That would be good for me: I could fly to Wyoming or Tennessee, study my ass off for three years, make any connections I can, and then work as an attorney until I die. On the other hand, perhaps it would be unwise for a young man to just up and move to some distant place, attend a law school for three years and expect the industry/the system to employ me, assuming adequate performance on my end.\]

Does my question make sense? I can elaborate if prompted..."

Because 1 year doesn't count as a term, there seemingly is nothing in the constitution preventing this from repeating over and over again for say 20 terms. This isn't some weird interpretation of 22nd amendment using the word elected and not serving (opening the theoretical possibility of being president via succession like Gerald Ford). Now obviously this scenario is very unrealistic but the question is ""how long can a President serve"" not ""how long can a President realistically serve"". I'd argue 10 years is pretty unrealistic.

If you timely file a criminal complaint with law enforcement, and they just sit on it until the statute of limitations is up, can the DA file charges since the victim's complaint was timely filed?

So, let’s say A injures B. It is so bad that it has to be settled in court. But B does not report what A did. If authorities find out about it, does the court still happen, even if the affected person (B) does not want it? Do the authorities just take over without B’s choice?

The police want to catch the others - but the only evidence these people have possibly communicated is through one of those apps that make messages disappear after a certain time. But is this only circumstantial evidence and not enough to charge for conspiracy?

I'm thinking I make the police bug the other suspects houses after they don't speak during their own interviews, but is this realistic? I've read about intrusive surveillance in England, would suspicion of conspiracy of murder be enough to apply to courts to bug someone's house? Can I get police to even set up an undercover officer to get close to the other characters or is this not realistic?"

The politician's proposal and the client's actions are both questionable, but the outcome is uncertain.","The whole thing started with a news article about a minor russian politician who proposed a legal initiative to criminalize the industry of fortune tellers, psychics, withces and so on. And not for the reasons of fraud. According to him, it must be done because witches and psychics do cause some measurable harm to a person they curse, and they attempt to exert a mind influence over a person when making a love spell, making them unable to act on their own free will. Invisible danger, real harm, bla-bla-bla. The whole thing was fucking riddiculous. But it sparked a discussion with my friends: would acquiring witch's services technically be an *attempt* to influence or harm somebody (very ineffectual one, but still) or would it be just a thought crime? My original line of thought was ""you didn't just *wish* John was dead, you took some steps to actually make it happen"", but then again, at no point was John placed in any real danger. That led me to dive down a rabbithole of articles and threads explaining impossible crimes and impossibility defence.

So, here is the question: **""Could hiring a psychic to kill somebody by supernatural means be considered an attempted murder if a client** **~~or a psychic~~**   **in question had genuinely believed it to succeed?""** *(upd:ok, a psychic did no crime here, as in 4th quote)*

At first, I considered wording a question as ""...to place a lethal curse on somebody"", but that would constitute a legal impossibility as in ""it's not illegal to curse people"". Simple. But I'm still not sure about the whole ""placing a hit on somebody with a party physically unable to complete it"" concept. I've found different attempts to explain factual vs legal impossibility here on reddit, and I can't pick the right one:

&gt;""Factual impossibility = if the facts (not the law) were as you thought they were, and you did what you attepmted to do, you would have commited a crime""

By this definition, the client thought that it was possible to kill a person with a curse and that the transaction would result in his target being dead. Would it be similar to hiring an undercover cop to kill someone? The target was not in any danger, but it might have been, would the killer be genuine or the curse - working.

&gt;Legal Impossibility: The thing you are attempting to do is not a crime. You certainly attempted, but you attempted something...perfectly legal, although you thought it wasn't. (Policy: You cannot punish people for thought crimes; in this situation, there is no actus reas, so punishing someone for a legally impossible attempt at crime is tantamount to punishing them for a thought crime.)  
Factual Impossibility: You attempted to commit a crime, but due to some fact, the crime was never possible to have been committed from your attempt. (ex: you plan to ambush and murder X at Y location he normally frequents at Z time. You buy a gun and wait for X. Turns out X has moved to a different country, so it was never possible for your attempt to result in a crime). This is still a crime because if he had been there, you would have murdered him. You have both a guilty mind and a guilty act (mens rea and actus reas), so you are guilty of attempt.

So, the client attempted to commit a murder, but in fact he just obtained a psychic's consultation, which is perfectly legal.

&gt;Legal impossibility: stealing a balloon on free balloon day (the most memorable way to visualize this rule)  
Factual Impossibility: attempted to poison someone but unknowingly used flour instead of fentanyl

It looks like fentanyl example is applicable, but I'm still conflicted. Like, there are some poisons that can kill a person. You just picked a wrong one. But there is no psychic that can harm a person with their mind, like there is no possible way to steal a free balloon.

&gt;The actus reus of an attempted crime requires an **overt act beyond mere preparation.**  
if a defendant attempts to use his ""telepathy"" to murder their neighbor, but their attempt fails, it is unlikely that a jury would consider telepathy to be an overt act - the defendant's actions simply do not meet the criteria of an overt act beyond mere preparation.

or am I just overthinking things and it all comes to the quote up above?

Could you untangle this for me, please? It's been an exciting search, but at this point I just want to be done with it XD

...on a tangent, could adding a ""love potion"" (if the perpetrator considers it real) to someone's drink be considered an attempted date rape/attempted drink spiking? Technically, it's not an attempt to ""cause another to consume unknowingly a controlled substance"" as the substance used is not a controlled one. But the spiking was made with an intent to put a target into an incapacitated state so they are unable to refuse, or to acquire a formal consent against their will. Thoughts?

**UPD**: I'm not asking if the person in question should be tried for using magic per se. That's absurd. I'm asking what should happen if the person had an intent to kill somebody and tried some stupid shit to achieve it (thinking it would work) - but had no actual chance to harm the target."
